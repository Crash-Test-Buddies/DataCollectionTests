# Collecting data:

Run the tests with the phone connected to a computer running Android Studio. Filter the logs by `STEP:`. Select all and copy and paste the results to a text file (in this directory is easiest).

# Basic analysis:

Using python 3 run the `analysis.py` script. A typical run might be:

`$ python analysis.py datafile.txt`

This will print out very basic analysis and also create a file called `output.csv` that can be opened with a spreadsheet tool such as excel.
